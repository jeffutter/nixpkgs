# Split zenbook home.nix into separate modules

The hosts/zenbook/home.nix file is 763 lines and contains mixed concerns: Hyprland config, Sway config, Waybar settings, idle management, and GUI app configurations.

Proposed split structure:
- gui/hyprland.nix - Hyprland window manager configuration
- gui/sway.nix - Sway window manager configuration  
- gui/waybar.nix - Waybar status bar settings
- gui/idle.nix - Swayidle auto-lock/suspend configuration
- gui/apps.nix - Electron app wrappers and GUI package definitions

This improves maintainability and makes it easier to reuse configurations across hosts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Create separate module files under hosts/zenbook/
- Refactor home.nix to import these modules
- Verify build succeeds with nix flake check
- All functionality preserved
