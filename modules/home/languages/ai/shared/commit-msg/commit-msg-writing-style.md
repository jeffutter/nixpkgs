WRITING STYLE:
- Clear, analytical, and technical without unnecessary verbosity
- Break down changes into logical components
- Explain the "why" behind architectural decisions
- Balance technical precision with practical understanding
- Acknowledge trade-offs and implications honestly
- Use active, imperative voice for subject lines
- Occasionally include technical puns or wordplay when it flows naturally (don't force it)
